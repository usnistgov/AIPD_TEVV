# Topics for the NIST Open Source Portal <https://code.nist.gov>
#
# Set the topic tags for your open source repository from the nested
# list below. Un-comment the relevant lines:
#
#     remove the `#` character *and* the space immediately after it
#
# so that the YAML syntax remains valid. You may delete everything
# that does not apply, and add new topics from the NIST Taxonomy
# <https://data.nist.gov/od/id/691DDF3315711C14E0532457068146BE1907>
#
# For example, a valid version of this file would be (note the `:`
# and `---`, they are important!) as follows:
#
# ---
# categories:
#   - scientific-software
#
# themes:
#   - Information Technology
#       - Software research
#           - Software performance
#
# Since scientific-software is most common it is left as the default
# category. Feel free to comment it with a hash (#) if it does not
# apply. There is no default theme; select as many as are relevant.
# Make sure to remove unwanted categories as the final topics are
# produced from this file.
